**What is this?**

Every project need a strong and solid foundation, when your project grows, this will become critical and the goal of this base template is to serve as the fundation for your project. We have save you some time and pre-build a sample project that can be easily adapted to your needs.

- All global elements are grouped in a single file, **global.xml**
- All errors default to a single flow in **error.xml** to isolate it for the other files and flows
- The environment variable (**mule.env**) will load all the files, properties and variables for that specific environment.
- No hardcoded properties in mule elements, it load them from the YAML properties file

**Is there any "minimal" prerequisites?**

 - Anypoint Studio 7.4 with Maven ([link](https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/studio))
 - JDK 8 ([Link](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot))

**Should I do anything about Maven?**

- Anypoint Studio include Maven and **you don't need to re install it**, as for the project dependencies, this project does not require any special or customs dependencies or repositories so no need to change anything on your [settings.xml](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html) file.
